# Course: R programming
Materials for my R programming course https://stepic.org/course/497
  - .Rmd files contain presentation sources
  - htmls are built from Rmds using rmarkdown and revealjs
  - .R files contain practical examples

There may be minor differences between these files and those shown in lectures.
